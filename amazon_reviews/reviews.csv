Abhishek Agarwal,3.0,Bad bad camera,Reviewed in India on 2 August 2020,"It's not very often I leave a critical review for any product. But i was so excited when my new OnePlus Nord got delivered to me earlier today, ahead of time. While i am still exploring the phone, the one aspect that is a complete let down is the camera. The pics I clicked were grainy and so not cool. I must say oneplus, you guys really turned me off this time, like honestly. Most phones these days look and feel alike with the camera being one aspect that sets the winners apart from ordinary phones...i dont know what you guys did here. Not expected team OnePlus...this is just not you. My Poco F1 that i purchased 2 years back returned 10 times better pics. Since i cant return this item, I'm going to live with this for a while before i upgrade. I am sorry for the negative review."
Kiran KS,4.0,The original segment of One Plus,Reviewed in India on 3 August 2020,"Battery usage update: Drains faster than other one plus models...so for the ones travelling frequently, this might not be an ideal phone...fast charging is a relief for ones who have access to charging point....
Morning to Night usage possible with moderate to slightly heavy usage....

Bottomline: A good entry phone for those who have never experienced One Plus and the ones with budget constraints... For others, one plus 8T(lighter than pro model at 180 gms) would be ideal which should bring 120Hz refresh rate and maybe wireless charging too..And for those who can afford and dont mind a heavy phone(200+ gms), One plus 8 pro or 8T Pro would be ideal ones.(As per Amazon reviews some users are reporting display issues with 8 pro, so 8T Pro hopefully will be a better model.) I still use 7T pro which provides the best of One Plus experience...

INITIAL IMPRESSIONS:
No tint issue which has been widely reported.
Smooth given 12gb RAM and 90Hz refresh rate.
Lighter than Pro Model but still feels sturdy.
Camera quality on par with top model one plus devices in case of outdoor pictures,
Indoor/low light pictures are not that good...
Not a fan of punch hole cameras..would have preferred full screen with pop up instead.
Battery usage - needs to be tested but seems to be ok...."
Aman More,4.0,A good daily driver.,Reviewed in India on 3 August 2020,"Pros:
1) Clean and bloatfree OxygenOS, which runs as smooth as they come.
2) AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate really go along to make the display above average.
3) Battery life is decent and will last a day on normal usage.
4) Sound quality is good and modestly loud. (Drawback in Cons)
5) The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience.
6) Gaming performance is average. (Similar phones in this range have better gaming performances)
7) The phone looks and feels premium while using.
8) The alert slider makes it very convenient to switch between different modes.
9) Face Unlock is as fast as other OnePlus phones. (Very very fast)

Cons:
1) The camera is not as good as it was expected. The macro lens is pretty useless, and the main camera lacks depth and the colors aren't as vibrant as OnePlus 8. A bit too much of beautification was there in selfie shots. 4K video recording @ 60fps is absent but 1080@60fps performance is quite good. (The camera is better than most phones out there but it isn't what we were promised)
2) No headphone jack.
3) The mono speaker is on the bottom right of the phone, which tends to get covered by your hand while using. Also, being on just one side of the phone, the audio isn't as well delivered as it is on a stereo speaker.
4) No expandable memory slot.
5) The plastic frame (doesn't look like plastic but it is) is a worrying thing and makes the phone *comparatively* less durable.
6) Fingerprint scanner being under the screen isn't as quick as a traditional fingerprint scanner on the back.

Recommendation: If you're looking for a phone which delivers high performance and smooth interface for your daily use, go for it.
But if your prime purpose is gaming, there are better options available.
Also, if you're expecting flagship camera performance, you might want to consider other phones. (Pixel 4a is about to release, that's far better probably)

Update: Pixel 4a camera is surely much better that Nord's camera."
Nikhil,0.0,*Read before you buy!!*,Reviewed in India on 4 August 2020,"Yea..pre-ordered on 28 July, got it on 4 August. Package was nice without any damage. So here is my first impression:
‚Ä¢ Display is so nice and 90 hz refresh rate feels so nice and smooth.
‚Ä¢Camera is okay, but not upto the mark..macro lens and depth sensor at the back is just crap. Wide angle is okay, but images are too smooth without any crispness.
‚Ä¢60 fps video recording at 4K is not there at rear cam, but is present for front cam. Don't know why they did thatüòÖ
‚Ä¢Premium user-experience.
‚Ä¢face unlock and in-display fingerprint is good.
‚Ä¢Phone lacks a true premium feel due to the plastic frame.
‚Ä¢The signature slide button delivers the same good experience.

Okay, so if you feel that you need a 5G chipset and be future-proof, definitely go for it. If you want a flagship perfomance, go for K20 pro or OnePlus 7T as this wont be a good choice for heavy users, but still a good experience in regards of games for a short-run(COD in high graphics and frame rate ran smooth without any sudden frame drops, because it got an overclocked GPU). StillI am satisfied with what I got here‚úåÔ∏è

*UPDATED*
‚Ä¢Excellent charging speed(Thanks to Warp charge, 10 to 100 in less than an hour)
‚Ä¢Battery backup is so good for daily users. Lasts almost a day.
‚Ä¢No serious heating issues at all.
‚Ä¢This is a mid-range phone(one of the best) and should not expect a monster perfomance from it.
‚Ä¢One of the best choice as a daily-driver( If heavy perfomance is not your priority)"
Sreeram,1.0,Totally dissatisfied. No AR support.,Reviewed in India on 3 August 2020,"I bought this phone for augmented reality purpose. They even launched it with the caption ""World First AR launching"". But this Nord is not supporting Augmented reality. I am damn fooled by One plus. Totally disappointed for my long wait. 500 rupees is wasted for prelaunch.
AR is must and should technology in 2020phones. Even 10K phones are giving better support.Why One plus released a skull without brain. So I return this worthless (for me). Waste of time."
Deblina Roy,2.0,Disappointing,Reviewed in India on 4 August 2020,"Heavily disappointed. So much of hype and the camera is not even upto the mark. Grainy pictures, looks like I have applied some kind of filter for my selfies. There is no way to undo it. The haptic feedback is good. However, there are several bugs on this phone. Hoping that they will get it fixed with an update! Also don‚Äôt panic and nitpick with screen quality! Looks great to me!
But don‚Äôt fall for the marketing gimmick. OnePlus promised something extraordinary and they have failed. Also, there were several troubles while registering my phone for the Red Cable Club. But several attempts and a complaint with the customer care, it was solved."

Stop cheating customers by arranging a tempered delivery with only an empty mobile box. It's my hard earned money and the Amazon investigation team is refuting all claims.
I have enough evidences to prove my claim of tempered delivery and will escalate the matter to the highest level and will also drag Amazon India on all social media besides suing them.in Consumer court."
Amit,0.0,Near to mid range Perfection,Reviewed in India on 3 August 2020,"Got it delivered yesterday , used for about 5-6 hours , to tell you this is my first mid ranger previously I was using s9 plus , before that s7 edge and iphones in stone age .

My first one plus , a mid ranger , I assure you it's no less a flagship experience , forget bout negative reviews, no device is perfect .

This one has looks , power and performance , don't know how useful is 5G modem but who cares that's the baggage we consider it as of now

Camera unit is also awesome perfoms well and remember it's a bloat free and advt free experience of OXYGEN OS .

Cons , I am yet to discover

ENJOY the NORD"
Sudeshna Dey,1.0,Bad front camera,Reviewed in India on 3 August 2020,"Front camera is very bad , and low light photo is also bad. Need update in camera section. Worst camera. I was also excited about this product like everyone else because I was going with the one plus brand. But if u r investing 28k for a mobile then it should satisfy your basic average needs at least. The camera quality is below average. 1 rating giving only for this. Otherwise features are good."
Krithika,0.0,Great price!,Reviewed in India on 4 August 2020,"An amazing phone!
Got it delivered today and also received red cable membership which was unexpected.
Formally had a one plus too and in comparison this one could've been a lot more better.
The silicone case that came with it however, has the most horrible smell. Wash it before using it on your phone.
Camera could've been a little better.
The touch is not as smooth as the other one plus phones.
Fast as hell.
Colors are very vibrant.
Does not have a notification LED. or a earphone jack.
The grey is very attractive. Blue will be better.
Will update on display issues (claims by many) after a month's time."
Amazon Customer,1.0,One plus Nord issues,Reviewed in India on 3 August 2020,Display has green tint issue..display looks like a very cheap quality phone. Want to return the phone but amazon is not offering return on this phone.
Rahul,4.0,Good phone,Reviewed in India on 2 August 2020,"Pro
Smooth OS - no lags at all
AMOLED screen is good quality screen
Privacy - no useless apps like those found in chinese phones
All other pros we would expect for these specs - no deviations

Con
Not a metal frame
CPU is slower compared to current 865 flagships (this is expecetd)

Note: I am releived the display is fine at low brightness - I read some users sharing the green tint issue. I did not face that yet. Will update reviews in case of any issues."
rishabh,1.0,"cheap camera, overpriced phone.",Reviewed in India on 5 August 2020,don't go on brand name and look. very bad camera. i have vivo z1 pro and believe me it was clicking better picture than one plus nord and vivo is only for 18k. one plus is now conning the buyers and breaking their trust. this is really a overpriced and my first and last OnePlus product.
Amazon Customer,4.0,OnePlus nord,Reviewed in India on 4 August 2020,I used several phone except like this type of phone but this phone is very silky smoothy.90hz refresh rate speed is very good or smooth like an iPhone 11.the keypad touch was also very smooth.audio is mono speaker only but it is also good audiable(something missing in the speaker).the camera is fair.i think next update this camera quality also increase.this phone very very user-friendly .wrap charging is 30 minute time take 0 to 65% charge completed that was very excited.the I appreciated OnePlus company because of less price for nord.
Dinesh Kumar,1.0,Bed battery,Reviewed in India on 3 August 2020,It's very poor phone company lair battery charger 30min 70% but it's not true
ARYA,3.0,'More than midrange but less than premium '. This phone has heating issues...üò•,Reviewed in India on 3 August 2020,"OnePlus Nord is a very competitive smartphone in this segment.
Pros.
Device is pretty impressive and looks premium ...
1. screen looks great
2. Camera works descently but after some struggle
3. Warp charge
4.12 gb ram is great and is very helpful during multitasking
5.screen brightness

Cons.
1.even when Snapdragon is said to be best chip in this range ,it's the one with same performance as Snapdragon 845 wrapped up with new ai engine ,it still struggles to maintain smooth experience.
2. Screen refresh rate of 90hz but due to less processing power it struggles to maintain the refresh rate.
3. Mono speaker
It's not stereo speakers and you will miss this if you want more bass.
4.ufs 2.1
The storage speed and data transfer speed decrease is observed if you've used ufs 3.0

All over this budget pack gets everything right but the hands on experience says even after having better cooling system in it..

I have observed that my nord actually heats up very fast and it takes time to cool.

If you're the one who is pretty intrested to use the phone continuously for several hours ,I would recommend you to reconsider this once again.

This thing heats up pretty fast and it suffers to maintain the peak performance..

OnePlus tried to bring a top tier performance to its midranger device and their performance is good but not great , OnePlus Nord does not make upto it's marketing hype. There are several potholes in this smooth experience and I expect it to be corrected during software updates and future nord segment.

It's just a midranger phone in the end.
For the best you can have I would suggest that you should see 8pro from OnePlus

Hope this helps ...thanks"
Ayush,1.0,Display issues and Delay in delivery,Reviewed in India on 8 August 2020,"1 star for the display. Green and purple tint clearly visible in daylight without even going into dark room and reducing brightness. Even the black bar is clearly visible in dark theme. My iphone 6 and oneplus 3 have a better panel than this.

And 0 stars to Amazon and the seller Darshita electronics for the delay in order. Preordered on 28th and received on 8th. Whereas people who ordered on prime day sale got the phone quicker.

Will never pre-order again and definitely not from Amazon."
Saikrishna,1.0,Disappointed,Reviewed in India on 4 August 2020,"Being OnePlus user from start.. Expected lot from this mobile.. Nord in hand doesn't give that premium experience that u get from rest OnePlus mobiles...Build is very cheap...This mobile is like oppo, vivo...

Should hav gone for OnePlus 8... Extremely dissatisfied"
Amazon Customer,0.0,Changed to Nord from 6t,Reviewed in India on 4 August 2020,"I was skeptical about changing from One plus 6t to Nord as 845 still have more processing power than 765 and 5G won't be available in India for next 2 years, Nord has gorilla glass 5, whereas OP6t had Gorilla glass 6.

But in the end, I am happy I switched, phone seems snappier, better display and new design. Camera is good and it was right time for oneplus to jump in upper mid range market, since their main lineup is getting expensive with each generation.
I don't do gaming, so 800 series was not necessary for me, Nord seemed like perfect substitute, since I am on oneplus since oneplus 1 days."
Manmohan Singh Tanwar,0.0,Auto call recorder not available,Reviewed in India on 2 August 2020,Where is call recording option
Rahul,1.0,Nothing great about this mobile,Reviewed in India on 22 August 2020,"I recently bought this phone after going thru the great praises from all the paid media. The very first shot from the so raved camera setup bursted the bubble. (I am Apple fan and will be Apple period and there is no turning back this was my last attempt). The Quality of image is so much doctored that it actual makes everything look so plastic. Tried GCAM too but that too not upto the mark of what iphone SE of first generation delivers. It just mediocre camera and output is HORRIBLE.
Felt so damn cheated.
To be honest even the Redmi phone used by one of my known gives better results with their two lense camera. If anyone is planning to buy this one please don't go for it , there are many better options at cheaper price. and if u can shell out few bucks more go for IPHONE SE trust me u will not regret it."
Nidhin Cherian,1.0,For camera enthusiasts,Reviewed in India on 5 August 2020,"Dear camera enthusiasts,

Don't go for OnePlus NORD. It is pretty much the opposite of the flagship camera that they had promised.

1. Poor low light performance especially for front camera
2. Lacks in sharp and crisp output

Better go for OnePlus 7T"
SAUMYA SRIVASTAVA,1.0,Half screen gone within 7 days of purchase - bad quality product,Reviewed in India on 2 October 2020,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
Within 7 days of use of the phone, the screen has started flickering. There is no return or support option available on amazon for this product. Would not suggest anyone to buy this phone, spending 27 odd k's on a phone only to use a phone with faulty hardware.

Had a chat with the amazon team. Refused to help."
Imran Khan,1.0,Packing was not good. Overall disappointed with product,Reviewed in India on 3 August 2020,"Delivery was fast, delivered on the mentioned date. Box packing was beaten. Unlike onplus box, all the edges were bent as if the box was fallen multiple times.

As per product, phone look good, for sure this doesn't look like a premium phone, unlike other oneplus phones. Box quality and finishing itself say this is a cheaper oneplus so don't expect premium experience.

Another disappointment from oneplus, the redcableclub doesn't work for Nord, on the redcableclub Nord model is not listed, evening phone setup when to try to link the device it fails stating this device is already linked to another account. Yet to explore the phone features and its performance. Will share it once is use it for couple of days.
---------++++------
After a month usage, I can rate this as most disappointing phone OnePlus has created. After few minutes in hand I can literally feel the pain due to its deisgn and weight. Biggest disappointment is the camera, out of 5 shots 3 will be blurry pixelated. Even after they pushed an update for camera still take couple of shots before you get one clear blurr free picture. You can only take still photos even a slightest movement either the phone or the person moves picture turns blurr. Phones of low resolution and less expensive take better picture then Nord.

Definitely a big no to this phone. whish I could exchange it with some other phone. Maybe realme/ redmi"
GP,1.0,Screen has bands/strips of green and pink,Reviewed in India on 13 August 2020,Generally i don't write negative feedback. But this phone really has screen issue. The screen reflects in bands of green and pink. This is mainly visible in white backgrounds. It strains eyes. Want to return this phone.
Akhil,4.0,Best in it's range.,Reviewed in India on 3 August 2020,"Amazing design. Amazing feel. Pretty smooth. Best in its range. However, came across a bug on the first day of usage. Can't link device to redclub membership. This has been reported by multiple people on community and looks like the developers are looking into it. Apart from that the first day use has been really great. The battery is amazing. Using it since 12 hours and 40% still left.

Update- The bug was fixed on the same day."
Adarsh,1.0,OnePlus Nord Issue List & Deficiency list. 24 total issues . Think before you buy OnePlus Nord..,Reviewed in India on 4 September 2020,"Issue list:
1. During phone call screen get locked and you have to unlock again to do anything like disconnect call.
2. After every call you will get notification of phone getting updated.
3. Battery drain drastically. From 100% to 90% in 7 mins. (Not using any heavy apps. By just screen on).
4. Heating issues. Heats for just using messages, what's up and phone calls too. While charging it heats upto 45¬∞ C. So battery is going to get damaged very very soon.
5. Call logs missing. Last week call logs are also missing.
6. Bluetooth disconnect issues with headphones,buds,health tracker watches or any other Bluetooth devices. Quite embarrassing.
7. YouTube videos stuck halfway,not because of internet. That means video(visual stuck) and voice goes on. Like old TVs.
8. Wifi speed is low. Laptop shows 40 speed and Nord speed is 18 speed. Other mobile shows 38 speed.
9. Messages will be delivered late. OTP get received after few hours sometime.
10. Only few apps are permitted to have parallel apps. Mostly very generic. But if you need any specific app you can't.
11. Charger and red cable type C pin also heats up high during charging.
12. Camera do not open sometimes.
13. You have to Click and wait for photo to be captured without blur both front and back cameras.
14. Even if you do point 13. Still photos are not upto mark and night photos not atall upto mark.
15. OnePlus Nord is not tested mobile in Market. OnePlus don't agree but if it is tested then why there are so many issues.

Deficiency list:
1. No 3.5mm Jack.
2. Display tint issues. 90% devices have it.
3. No external memory slot.
4. No infrared to use as a remote of your TV and music system,smart light at home.
5. OnePlus Oxygen OS Contacts and Phone dialer apk is missing. And Google contacts and dialer has lot of issues and they are not stable.
6. OnePlus Oxygen OS message apk is missing.
7. Oxygen OS phone contacts, dialer and messages apks are actually signature of Oxygen OS without which Oxygen OS is clearly incomplete like half meal.
8. Plastic body.
9. No Automatic call recording. Big deficiency.

When talked to OnePlus they gave 100 reasons for deficiencies on this OnePlus Nord. No reason is sounds satisfactory. Mostly every reason OnePlus gave is silly excuse.

This is a consolidated list. If you see anything missing please add in comments.

All my issues I have raised with OnePlus bit nothing turned out to be resolved.

Visited OnePlus services center nothing resolved. Discussed with OnePlus customer care, feedbacks given complaints given for each issue given to them with logs, screenshot and what all OnePlus has asked for. I have spent many many hours to inform OnePlus about each and every issue of the above mentioned issues.

So please don't reply back to me to reach OnePlus team. This post it here because OnePlus did absolutely nothing to resolve these.

Dirty truth of the scenario."

The camera quality is below average. 1 rating giving only for this. Otherwise features are good."
Krithika,0.0,Great price!,Reviewed in India on 4 August 2020,"An amazing phone!
Got it delivered today and also received red cable membership which was unexpected.
Formally had a one plus too and in comparison this one could've been a lot more better.
The silicone case that came with it however, has the most horrible smell. Wash it before using it on your phone.
Camera could've been a little better.
The touch is not as smooth as the other one plus phones.
Fast as hell.
Colors are very vibrant.
Does not have a notification LED. or a earphone jack.
The grey is very attractive. Blue will be better.
Will update on display issues (claims by many) after a month's time."
Amazon Customer,1.0,One plus Nord issues,Reviewed in India on 3 August 2020,Display has green tint issue..display looks like a very cheap quality phone. Want to return the phone but amazon is not offering return on this phone.
Rahul,4.0,Good phone,Reviewed in India on 2 August 2020,"Pro
Smooth OS - no lags at all
AMOLED screen is good quality screen
Privacy - no useless apps like those found in chinese phones
All other pros we would expect for these specs - no deviations

Con
Not a metal frame
CPU is slower compared to current 865 flagships (this is expecetd)

Note: I am releived the display is fine at low brightness - I read some users sharing the green tint issue. I did not face that yet. Will update reviews in case of any issues."
rishabh,1.0,"cheap camera, overpriced phone.",Reviewed in India on 5 August 2020,don't go on brand name and look. very bad camera. i have vivo z1 pro and believe me it was clicking better picture than one plus nord and vivo is only for 18k. one plus is now conning the buyers and breaking their trust. this is really a overpriced and my first and last OnePlus product.
Amazon Customer,4.0,OnePlus nord,Reviewed in India on 4 August 2020,I used several phone except like this type of phone but this phone is very silky smoothy.90hz refresh rate speed is very good or smooth like an iPhone 11.the keypad touch was also very smooth.audio is mono speaker only but it is also good audiable(something missing in the speaker).the camera is fair.i think next update this camera quality also increase.this phone very very user-friendly .wrap charging is 30 minute time take 0 to 65% charge completed that was very excited.the I appreciated OnePlus company because of less price for nord.

ARYA,3.0,'More than midrange but less than premium '. This phone has heating issues...üò•,Reviewed in India on 3 August 2020,"OnePlus Nord is a very competitive smartphone in this segment.
Pros.
Device is pretty impressive and looks premium ...
1. screen looks great
2. Camera works descently but after some struggle
3. Warp charge
4.12 gb ram is great and is very helpful during multitasking
5.screen brightness

Cons.
1.even when Snapdragon is said to be best chip in this range ,it's the one with same performance as Snapdragon 845 wrapped up with new ai engine ,it still struggles to maintain smooth experience.
2. Screen refresh rate of 90hz but due to less processing power it struggles to maintain the refresh rate.
3. Mono speaker
It's not stereo speakers and you will miss this if you want more bass.
4.ufs 2.1
The storage speed and data transfer speed decrease is observed if you've used ufs 3.0

All over this budget pack gets everything right but the hands on experience says even after having better cooling system in it..

I have observed that my nord actually heats up very fast and it takes time to cool.

If you're the one who is pretty intrested to use the phone continuously for several hours ,I would recommend you to reconsider this once again.

This thing heats up pretty fast and it suffers to maintain the peak performance..

OnePlus tried to bring a top tier performance to its midranger device and their performance is good but not great , OnePlus Nord does not make upto it's marketing hype. There are several potholes in this smooth experience and I expect it to be corrected during software updates and future nord segment.

It's just a midranger phone in the end.
For the best you can have I would suggest that you should see 8pro from OnePlus

Hope this helps ...thanks"
Ayush,1.0,Display issues and Delay in delivery,Reviewed in India on 8 August 2020,"1 star for the display. Green and purple tint clearly visible in daylight without even going into dark room and reducing brightness. Even the black bar is clearly visible in dark theme. My iphone 6 and oneplus 3 have a better panel than this.

And 0 stars to Amazon and the seller Darshita electronics for the delay in order. Preordered on 28th and received on 8th. Whereas people who ordered on prime day sale got the phone quicker.

Will never pre-order again and definitely not from Amazon."
Saikrishna,1.0,Disappointed,Reviewed in India on 4 August 2020,"Being OnePlus user from start.. Expected lot from this mobile.. Nord in hand doesn't give that premium experience that u get from rest OnePlus mobiles...Build is very cheap...This mobile is like oppo, vivo...

Should hav gone for OnePlus 8... Extremely dissatisfied"
Amazon Customer,0.0,Changed to Nord from 6t,Reviewed in India on 4 August 2020,"I was skeptical about changing from One plus 6t to Nord as 845 still have more processing power than 765 and 5G won't be available in India for next 2 years, Nord has gorilla glass 5, whereas OP6t had Gorilla glass 6.

But in the end, I am happy I switched, phone seems snappier, better display and new design. Camera is good and it was right time for oneplus to jump in upper mid range market, since their main lineup is getting expensive with each generation.
I don't do gaming, so 800 series was not necessary for me, Nord seemed like perfect substitute, since I am on oneplus since oneplus 1 days."

Rahul,1.0,Nothing great about this mobile,Reviewed in India on 22 August 2020,"I recently bought this phone after going thru the great praises from all the paid media. The very first shot from the so raved camera setup bursted the bubble. (I am Apple fan and will be Apple period and there is no turning back this was my last attempt). The Quality of image is so much doctored that it actual makes everything look so plastic. Tried GCAM too but that too not upto the mark of what iphone SE of first generation delivers. It just mediocre camera and output is HORRIBLE.
Felt so damn cheated.
To be honest even the Redmi phone used by one of my known gives better results with their two lense camera. If anyone is planning to buy this one please don't go for it , there are many better options at cheaper price. and if u can shell out few bucks more go for IPHONE SE trust me u will not regret it."
Nidhin Cherian,1.0,For camera enthusiasts,Reviewed in India on 5 August 2020,"Dear camera enthusiasts,

Don't go for OnePlus NORD. It is pretty much the opposite of the flagship camera that they had promised.

1. Poor low light performance especially for front camera
2. Lacks in sharp and crisp output

Better go for OnePlus 7T"
SAUMYA SRIVASTAVA,1.0,Half screen gone within 7 days of purchase - bad quality product,Reviewed in India on 2 October 2020,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
Within 7 days of use of the phone, the screen has started flickering. There is no return or support option available on amazon for this product. Would not suggest anyone to buy this phone, spending 27 odd k's on a phone only to use a phone with faulty hardware.

Had a chat with the amazon team. Refused to help."
Imran Khan,1.0,Packing was not good. Overall disappointed with product,Reviewed in India on 3 August 2020,"Delivery was fast, delivered on the mentioned date. Box packing was beaten. Unlike onplus box, all the edges were bent as if the box was fallen multiple times.

As per product, phone look good, for sure this doesn't look like a premium phone, unlike other oneplus phones. Box quality and finishing itself say this is a cheaper oneplus so don't expect premium experience.

Another disappointment from oneplus, the redcableclub doesn't work for Nord, on the redcableclub Nord model is not listed, evening phone setup when to try to link the device it fails stating this device is already linked to another account. Yet to explore the phone features and its performance. Will share it once is use it for couple of days.
---------++++------
After a month usage, I can rate this as most disappointing phone OnePlus has created. After few minutes in hand I can literally feel the pain due to its deisgn and weight. Biggest disappointment is the camera, out of 5 shots 3 will be blurry pixelated. Even after they pushed an update for camera still take couple of shots before you get one clear blurr free picture. You can only take still photos even a slightest movement either the phone or the person moves picture turns blurr. Phones of low resolution and less expensive take better picture then Nord.

Definitely a big no to this phone. whish I could exchange it with some other phone. Maybe realme/ redmi"
GP,1.0,Screen has bands/strips of green and pink,Reviewed in India on 13 August 2020,Generally i don't write negative feedback. But this phone really has screen issue. The screen reflects in bands of green and pink. This is mainly visible in white backgrounds. It strains eyes. Want to return this phone.
Akhil,4.0,Best in it's range.,Reviewed in India on 3 August 2020,"Amazing design. Amazing feel. Pretty smooth. Best in its range. However, came across a bug on the first day of usage. Can't link device to redclub membership. This has been reported by multiple people on community and looks like the developers are looking into it. Apart from that the first day use has been really great. The battery is amazing. Using it since 12 hours and 40% still left.

Update- The bug was fixed on the same day."
Adarsh,1.0,OnePlus Nord Issue List & Deficiency list. 24 total issues . Think before you buy OnePlus Nord..,Reviewed in India on 4 September 2020,"Issue list:
1. During phone call screen get locked and you have to unlock again to do anything like disconnect call.
2. After every call you will get notification of phone getting updated.
3. Battery drain drastically. From 100% to 90% in 7 mins. (Not using any heavy apps. By just screen on).
4. Heating issues. Heats for just using messages, what's up and phone calls too. While charging it heats upto 45¬∞ C. So battery is going to get damaged very very soon.
5. Call logs missing. Last week call logs are also missing.
6. Bluetooth disconnect issues with headphones,buds,health tracker watches or any other Bluetooth devices. Quite embarrassing.
7. YouTube videos stuck halfway,not because of internet. That means video(visual stuck) and voice goes on. Like old TVs.
8. Wifi speed is low. Laptop shows 40 speed and Nord speed is 18 speed. Other mobile shows 38 speed.
9. Messages will be delivered late. OTP get received after few hours sometime.
10. Only few apps are permitted to have parallel apps. Mostly very generic. But if you need any specific app you can't.
11. Charger and red cable type C pin also heats up high during charging.
12. Camera do not open sometimes.
13. You have to Click and wait for photo to be captured without blur both front and back cameras.
14. Even if you do point 13. Still photos are not upto mark and night photos not atall upto mark.
15. OnePlus Nord is not tested mobile in Market. OnePlus don't agree but if it is tested then why there are so many issues.

Deficiency list:
1. No 3.5mm Jack.
2. Display tint issues. 90% devices have it.
3. No external memory slot.
4. No infrared to use as a remote of your TV and music system,smart light at home.
5. OnePlus Oxygen OS Contacts and Phone dialer apk is missing. And Google contacts and dialer has lot of issues and they are not stable.
6. OnePlus Oxygen OS message apk is missing.
7. Oxygen OS phone contacts, dialer and messages apks are actually signature of Oxygen OS without which Oxygen OS is clearly incomplete like half meal.
8. Plastic body.
9. No Automatic call recording. Big deficiency.

When talked to OnePlus they gave 100 reasons for deficiencies on this OnePlus Nord. No reason is sounds satisfactory. Mostly every reason OnePlus gave is silly excuse.

This is a consolidated list. If you see anything missing please add in comments.

All my issues I have raised with OnePlus bit nothing turned out to be resolved.

Visited OnePlus services center nothing resolved. Discussed with OnePlus customer care, feedbacks given complaints given for each issue given to them with logs, screenshot and what all OnePlus has asked for. I have spent many many hours to inform OnePlus about each and every issue of the above mentioned issues.

So please don't reply back to me to reach OnePlus team. This post it here because OnePlus did absolutely nothing to resolve these.

Dirty truth of the scenario."

ADIL.T.M,4.0,"Redmi 9 hhoo, 9, 9ü§©, 9, changed mind",Reviewed in India on 6 September 2020,"Let‚Äôs make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve ‚Äî the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in ‚Äî the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing
üá©¬†üá™¬†üá∏¬†üáÆ¬†üá¨¬†üá≥
Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I‚Äôd still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What‚Äôs more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn‚Äôt strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.
üá©¬†üáÆ¬†üá∏¬†üáµ¬†üá±¬†üá¶¬†üáæ
The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it‚Äôs large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it‚Äôs an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn‚Äôt enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it‚Äôs just not bright enough.
üÖ±üÖ∞üÜÉüÜÉüÖ¥üÜÅüÜà
The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow ‚Äî the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?
üÖ≤üÖ∞üÖºüÖ¥üÜÅüÖ∞
There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There‚Äôs an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps."

I am very disappointed by the camera quality of this phone.
12 megapixel feels like 2MP camera.
Recently i am using redmi note 5 pro. And this phone is just downgraded phone by redmi .you cannot imagine low light photography in this phone.
The back plastic body feels like a cheap phone.

Amazon was not ready to take the return as they have a new policy now which is replacement policy so they will get you a replacement but won't take it back. Bought that in sale as had heard from friends that redmi phones are good but it ain't. Will suggest not to buy at all from Amazon as it's better to go and buy from the store atleast they take 500rs and will exchange the product. Speaker is poor you can not hear properly on speaker at all. Product is not worth in this price range as one can get better options by payin 1000-2000 bucks extra.

Better choose some other phone than this. It has no notification light and has a micro USB charging port. No night mode in camera.

You can't video call and many more issue.
