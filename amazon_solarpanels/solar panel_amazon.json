There are some visible scratches in the glass covering the module. The frame material is not good and it cannot withstand high wind for long years. The output current never touches the given 9.3amps. I tried all angles and every half an hour in bright sunlight. The maximum current given by the panel is 8.23. In my opinion it may not lasts longer than 5-6 years.\nAfter 15 days of use I get only 224 watts maximum during 12.45PM to 1.30PM when both panels are connected in parallel (Not 360 watts maximum). The maximum peak working current provided by both panels in parallel are 16.32 amps only i.e., 8.16 ampere for each panel. The efficiency is slightly lower than poly crystalline panels.

In Bangalore the rainy season we see sunlight rarely. Though it is producing energy entire day and not even equivalent to 1 unit (Kwh) of energy. So not so productive and efficient as expected. The build quality of frame as well not that much great and it is shaky for normal winds itself. So I need to see its performance on sunny day.
